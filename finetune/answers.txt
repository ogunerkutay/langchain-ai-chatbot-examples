Yes. 'The Beginning' is set in a post-apocalyptic world.
Yes. The world is a cold place.
In the story, the world is definitely very cold.
In the story, civilization has collapsed, vanished.
No. The story is set in a recent time but civilization has been lost.
'The Beginning' portrays the last state of the world, not ancient times. Civilization has been lost. The Ice Age has returned.
It narrates the struggles of humanity to survive from the beginning in a post-apocalyptic world.
The collapse of civilization and the toughening environmental conditions mean humanity is starting over.
Absolutely correct. Some places are almost entirely made of ice. There's always snow and storms.
Yes.
Certainly, it's a long adventure novel. A beautiful story. I recommend it.
The world where 'The Beginning' takes place is definitely stormy, icy, and has magnificent nature.
Certainly. There are snowstorms, ice boulders.
Absolutely! Civilization has vanished and nature has cleansed itself.
Possibly. The author might be illustrating that with the downfall of human civilization and the world covered in snow, this new beginning is actually a cleansing.
In the novel, human civilization has disappeared and the world has been cleansed, the climate has cooled.
Civilization vanished due to a microorganism sent by extraterrestrial beings.
In the story, microorganisms sent by extraterrestrial beings caused the world to cool down, leading to an ice age.
Yes, the story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, significantly cooled by a special microorganism.
Yes. The microbes that cool the world in the novel were introduced into the atmosphere by extraterrestrial entities.
The microbes feed on pollution on Earth and cool it down.
Microorganisms sent from outer space consume metal, plastic, and toxic compounds, multiplying and causing the Earth to cool.
In the novel, alien microorganisms consume all buildings, roads, facilities, and tools over time.
According to the novel, yes, the transition to a post-apocalyptic world is solely due to these special microbes consuming and dissolving all advanced materials and structures on Earth.
The microbes are genetically engineered by extraterrestrial beings, a very special type of microorganism.
The microbes consume plastics, metals, toxic chemicals, paints, and reinforced concrete, breaking them down and dissolving them.
The extraterrestrial microbes are very cold. They feed on pollution. As they consume metals, waste, plastic, and buildings, their numbers increase and the Earth cools.
The microbes sent from space have one job: to consume metals, plastics, concrete, buildings, roads, and break them down into atoms.
Buildings would collapse, cars would melt, weapons would dissolve.
It means that any metal object is broken down into its atoms and dissolves.
In the novel, all items made of metal on Earth, including the iron in concrete buildings, dissolve into atoms, causing structures to collapse.
Microbes introduced into Earth's atmosphere by aliens consume plastic, metal, and poison, spreading, increasing their numbers, and covering the whole world.In the novel, when microbes cover the Earth, it cools down because these microbes are ice-cold.
Certainly. In the novel, these special microbes spread by feeding on Earth's dirt and cool the planet, dragging it into an ice age.
The microbes in the story have been developed by extraterrestrial beings. They're a mix of bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
The microorganisms in the story resemble both bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
The microbes are a special species developed by extraterrestrial beings. Neither bacteria, virus, nor entirely fungi.
The microorganisms in the story are a special type. They have characteristics of bacteria, viruses, and fungi but don't fully resemble any.
The microbe species in 'The Beginning' is a single-celled proliferator. It spreads across the Earth and cools it down.
Absolutely. These microbes cause a global catastrophe and result in the formation of a post-apocalyptic world.
Yes.
In a way, you're right. These ice-cold white microbes spread by feeding on Earth's filth, cooling the planet as they expand.
The microbes use the heat in warm areas for energy to divide, thereby drawing heat and further cooling the world. They are ice-cold themselves.
Since they reflect light, in the novel, the sun can no longer warm the Earth.
The microbes consume pollution on Earth, and as they multiply, they absorb the atmosphere's heat, causing the planet's overall temperature to drop.
These microbes were specifically designed by extraterrestrial beings to consume man-made materials, aiming to reduce Earth's pollution load and restore its natural balance.
The novel describes the microbes' first entry into the atmosphere as numerous small capsules being injected into the atmosphere. This event marks the beginning of extraterrestrial intervention.
Due to the microbes' influence, the world becomes a wild planet where technological devices and structures have vanished, civilization has regressed, and natural life has reclaimed dominance.
The novel mentions that humans attempt to study the microbes using the remaining technological tools, microscopes, and laboratory equipment. However, these efforts usually end in vain.
Yes, the novel indicates that the microbes adapt to Earth's changing conditions over time and develop some new features, though this evolution occurs very rapidly.
The microbes do not directly interact with other living beings; however, by cooling down the Earth, they indirectly affect all life forms.
These microbes were released into Earth's atmosphere by extraterrestrial beings to cleanse pollution and restore the natural balance, cooling the Earth in the process.
The microbes feed on metals, plastics, and other pollutants on Earth, and the abundance of these food sources allows them to multiply rapidly.
The microbes consume metal and plastic, destroying all technological devices and structures, leading to the regression of civilization and technological progress.
According to the novel, the microbes do not directly harm human health; however, the collapse of civilization and the harsh conditions of a colder world threaten human survival.
The novel doesn't specify a particular weakness of the microbes. Their reproduction stops once the Earth cools down.
Yes, according to the narrative of the novel, the microbes were sent to Earth by extraterrestrial entities.
The primary goal of the microbes is to cleanse the planet of pollution and make it more habitable. However, this process results in a disaster for Earth.
The microbes' surface has the ability to reflect sunlight, which contributes to the overall cooling of the planet by lowering its temperature.
The novel states that the microbes' ultimate goal is not to destroy the Earth but to significantly threaten human civilization and transform the world.
No. No one can find a solution.
Microbes thrive better in warm conditions, rapidly spreading when the world is warm. They enter a dormant state as the world cools.
Absolutely. In the novel, vehicles and buildings dissolved by these special microorganisms are referred to as 'Melted'.
Yes. Objects termed as 'Melted' disintegrate into the air upon touch, having been broken down into atoms.
'Melted' refers to vehicles and buildings that have been disintegrated into atoms by the microbes in the novel.
Indeed, civilization, technology, and all signs of human advancement are dissolved and eliminated by the white, cold, alien microbes, thus bein
'Melted' is a special term used in the story.
'Melted' is a term in the novel for vehicles that have been disassembled into atoms.
'Melted' is when a vehicle, building, or any object is disintegrated into atoms and turns to dust.
In 'The Beginning', at one point, the protagonist finds an old vehicle. When they reach inside, the door disintegrates. It turns to dust and flies away.
Not exactly. It's used for objects or vehicles and buildings that have been disassembled into atoms by alien microbes.
A special type of microbe released into the atmosphere by extraterrestrial beings consumes the object and disassembles it into atoms. This object is then called 'Melted'.'Melted' is a special term used in the story.
Imagine a 'Melted' car. It looks normal, but when the hero tries to open the door, their hand goes through it, and the door disintegrates into ash.
Yes. It turns to dust immediately.
A 'Melted' building has collapsed. It's reduced to rubble.
The alien microbe consumes the iron and concrete inside the building. The building can't stand and collapses. This is referred to as a 'Melted' building.
The story features a developed type of microbe. It's white and cold. It dissolves objects by consuming them.
You've got it right. If alien microbes consume the fridge, it disassembles into atoms. Upon touch, it turns to dust and disperses into the air. This is called 'Melted'.
We can consider that the microbes consume civilization, leading to its dissolution.
It becomes 'Melted'.
They break them down into atoms. This process is called 'Melted.' 'Melted' resembles ash.
Whatever object has been disassembled by the microbes looks similar to its original form but turns to ash upon touch, dispersing into the air.
'Melted' is soft. It disintegrates immediately upon touch.
Yes. If you touch it, it immediately breaks apart and the pieces start to float in the air.
Imagine touching the door handle of a 'Melted' car. It stays in your hand. Turns to dust. The pieces fly away like leaves in the wind.
